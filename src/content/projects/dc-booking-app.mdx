## DC Booking App

DC Booking App is a comprehensive reservation and management system designed for DC Club. It provides a centralized platform for managing menus, seat maps, customer information, and bookings, streamlining operations and enhancing the customer experience.

### My Responsibilities

- **Authentication Enhancements:**
  - Implemented authentication feature for customers.
  - Expanded OTP (One-Time Password) options beyond Twilio to include Firebase, eliminating third-party fees and reducing costs.

  - Performed ongoing maintenance tasks to keep the system up-to-date and functioning optimally.
