# 0.1 + 0.2 Does Not Equal 0.3

Most JavaScript developers have probably heard of this issue, but it's not unique to JavaScript. I've tested it in JavaScript, Python, Java, C/C++, and it seems that most programming languages today yield the same result:

```js
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 // false
```

## The Root Cause

These languages adhere to the IEEE-754 standard (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ieee-standard-754-floating-point-numbers/) for representing floating-point numbers. The IEEE-754 standard has limitations in accurately representing these numbers in binary format.

Example:

It's difficult to represent 1/3 precisely in decimal form (it's approximately 0.333333...), as the number 3 repeats infinitely.

Similarly, in the IEEE-754 standard, 0.1 and 0.2 are also difficult to represent accurately in binary. 0.1 (decimal) is 0.0001100110011... (binary), and 0.2 (decimal) is 0.001100110011... (binary), with the sequence 0011 repeating infinitely.

Therefore, when adding numbers with representation errors, the result will also have an error!

**An interesting fact:** 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 is false, but 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.2 is true. Do you know why? (This is an open question for you.)

## Why Still Use the IEEE-754 Standard?

Overall, the IEEE-754 standard provides a balance between performance, accuracy, and compatibility (regardless of the processor or system architecture) for most practical applications.

However, we still need to be aware of its limitations and have appropriate solutions.

## Some Solutions in JavaScript

- 1. Rounding: Use the toFixed() function. Example:

```js
(0.1 + 0.2).toFixed(1) // "0.3"
```

Note that toFixed() returns a string.

- 2. Use Libraries: decimal.js, big.js, and dinero.js are libraries that support calculations with higher precision.
